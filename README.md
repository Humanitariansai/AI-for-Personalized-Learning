# **Course Structure & Pedagogy**

Humanitarians AI courses follow a **Learn → Build → Teach** model:

1. **Start with an outline**
   Volunteers collaboratively refine this document.

2. **Build hands-on labs before lectures**
   Including:

   * Jupyter notebooks
   * Prompt engineering exercises
   * Skill assessments
   * Organizational templates
   * Reflection tools

3. **Use Humanitarians Courses GPT**
   To auto-generate:

   * Lecture scripts
   * Slides
   * Lab guides
   * Teaching materials

4. **Record YouTube lectures**
   Covering:

   * Key ideas
   * Demonstrations
   * Student-built learning hacks
   * Interviews & case studies

5. **Continuous improvement**
   New contributors add labs, examples, datasets, and demos over time.
